  In React, "onKeyDown" is an event handler that can be used to capture and respond to keypresses when a user interacts with an element, such as an input field or a button. This event handler is similar to the "onkeydown" event in standard HTML/JavaScript but is used within Reactâ€™s component-based architecture.
